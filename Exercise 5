            <p>In this article, we will explore the top reasons to learn web development. But before moving on, let’s take a look at what is web development? Web development is the process of creating a website for the Internet. And the most immeasurable part is that it can be learned by anyone. The beauty of web development is that we can put graphics, videos, images, and more on the website. But do you know that when web development was born, then we used to use hyperlinks and text only? Now, without taking much time, let’s get started:</p>
            <h4>1. Easy To Learn</h4>
            <p>You only need two things to start it, one is a good laptop and the other is an internet connection. Your journey starts with scripting languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc., and building good-looking responsive websites with them. After a few miles, you will explore various areas in it such as front-end and back-end web development. At some point, you will need the knowledge of programming, which you can easily develop by learning any relevant programming language like Java, Python, etc.</p>
            <h4>2. Enhance Your Designing Skills</h4>
            <p>Web development is not just about coding, it is also about website designing. Before going into the process of development, you have to think about its layout, colors, fonts, visual assets, and more. This means that you can develop or enhance your design skills. You can also enhance your creativity by learning from others’ website designs present over the internet. A good website has a clean-quality design.</p>
            <h4>3. Develop Problem-Solving Skills</h4>
            <p>It will give you the power to contribute to the world. You can develop or improve your problem-solving skills with it. If you have an idea in your mind that solves real-world problems it will help you to create it. As a computer science student, if you have developed anything which has a good effect on the real world then it will definitely help you in your future careers. You can also participate in hackathons where you can solve real-world problems and hone your skills.</p>
            <h4>4. Open Source Contribution</h4>
            <p>It will also give you the opportunity to contribute to open-source projects and participate in open-source programs such as GSoC, Outreachy, etc. You can interact with various open-source contributors and learn from them. Open-source contributions have a powerful impact on their own and when it comes to a tech career, it’s a feather in one’s cap if it’s on your resume.</p>
            <h4>5. Earn Well From It</h4>
            <p>Everyone likes to make money, right? Of course, this is one of the best skills that give you a chance to earn money.
